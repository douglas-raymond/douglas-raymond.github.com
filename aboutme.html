<h2>Who am I?</h2>
<p>
	Hi! My name is Douglas and I'm a final year Computer Science student at Carleton University. My fields of interest in Computer Science range from Encryption to Back-End Development and a bit of Mobile app development, with my most recent interest being Artificial Intelligence. As a kid, I was an avid gamer and after playing _____, I wanted to understand the inner workings of this arcade game and become a programmer.  I spend the majority of my time listening to music and reading up on tech advances on good ole reddit.
	<br>
	Having said that, I make the time to work on my own projects. I've recently been working on a cross between logistics and a delivery app.
	<br> 
	If you're interested in working together or just want to contact me, feel free to send me a message 
	<br>
